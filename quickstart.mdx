Building with Builddrr is as simple as having a conversation. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Open the AI Chat

Visit [builddrr.com](https://builddrr.com) and **start chatting** with our AI.

### 2. Describe Your Website

The key to getting amazing results is crafting effective prompts. Here's how to communicate with our AI for the best outcomes:

## Good Prompt Examples ✅

**Detailed and Specific:**

```
"Create a modern portfolio website for my wedding photography business.
Include a hero section with my best photo, an about me section,
a gallery organized by wedding types, pricing packages,
and a contact form. Use elegant fonts and a romantic color palette."
```

**Clear Business Context:**

```
"Build an e-commerce store for handmade jewelry. Target audience is
women 25-45. Include product categories (rings, necklaces, earrings),
customer testimonials, size guides, and secure checkout.
Use pink and gold colors with clean, luxury aesthetic."
```

**Functional Requirements:**

```
"Design a SaaS landing page for project management software.
Need hero section, feature highlights, pricing table (3 tiers),
customer testimonials, FAQ section, and free trial signup.
Professional blue/white theme, mobile-responsive."
```

## Bad Prompt Examples ❌

**Too Vague:**

```
"Make me a website"
"I need a business site"
"Create something nice"
```

**Missing Context:**

```
"Build an online store"
(What products? Who's the audience? What style?)
```

**Conflicting Instructions:**

```
"Make it modern but also vintage, colorful but minimalist"
```
